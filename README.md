##There are many algorithms that deal with sorting collections of data. I will be going over a few examples.

####1.Bubble Sort
  This is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly goes through a list. It will compare items, then swaps the items if it is in the incorrect order. It will continue to go through the list until no incorrect items exists. Then it will go through the list one last time to complete.

   * Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   * Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.
